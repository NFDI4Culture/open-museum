Blocking: The museum has no data feed of exhibition dates or what is being exhibited. If the visitor wanted to share the information it would be a long, long, labour of love.\nMuseum exhibition organiser: Needs: Visitors and engagement. Blocking: No exhibition data available for people to find out about contemporary or past exhibitions. The museum should have all this data but is not making it public.\nSpecial interest group (Climate change education group): Need: Ensure that access to understanding of climate change is represented in regional museums. The group would contribute volunteer time to cataloging efforts and outreach. Blocking: Not able to find dates of exhibitions or information about what was exhibited.\n\n\nProblem / solution\n\n\nProblem: A museum visitor cannot share information about exhibitions or the exhited items as museums don’t publish this data.\nSolution: Support museum visitors to publish and use the data as a citizen science project ‘Open Museum’. The data is has two parts:\n\nCalendar of exhibitions, and\nCatalogue of items in an exhibition.\n\nBoth of these data would be catalogued and indexed using Wikimedia infrastructure.\n\n\nA schematic\n\n+--------------------+            +---------------------+             +-------------------+\n|                    |            |                     |             |                   |\n|                    |            |                     |             |                   |\n|                    |            |                     |             |                   |\n|                    |            |                     |             |                   |\n|       Data         +------------&gt;     The public      +------------&gt;|     Learning      |\n|                    |            |                     |             |                   |\n|                    |            |                     |             |                   |\n|                    |            |                     |             |                   |\n|                    |            |                     |             |                   |\n+--------------------+            +---------------------+             +-------------------+",

    "text": "Step-by-step guide\n\nBottom up analysis\nThe bottom up approach aims at gathering a minimal set of data to start with and focuses on one object and setting to do that. This is the opposite of going from the top down and using preexisting schemas, e.g., Painting, https://schema.org/Painting\nComplete these steps to create a version of a data model.\nWith each step conduct a review, test, and sign off. This can be a colleague, peer, or carry out the checks yourself.\nAn example completed data model is included, see: Example data models\n\nUse case\nBriefly write out the use case in plain language: What is the purpose of the data model? What is the starting point for the use case?\nThe use case is looking to make a data model using the following online database Baroque ceiling painting in Germany (CbDD): https://www.deckenmalerei.eu/\nExample use case:\nExhibition of Baroque paintings in buildings\n\nMinimal data structure for Baroque painting as exhibited in buildings. The paintings are frescos, ceiling paintings, and paintings. The buildings are castles, palaces, and other buildings, in the Federal State of Germany.\nIncluding the following:\n\nHold the minimal amount of information to describe the paintings and their exhibition locations.\nThe paintings are the focus of the exercise.\n\nDescribe the the paintings as they exist in castles and palaces in Germany.\nDescribe the locations of the castles and palaces and the rooms inside the buildings.\nDescribe information about the paintings.\nDescribe the art historical records of the paintings and locations**.**\n\n\n\nReview questions:\n1.     Is the use case narrow enough?\n2.     Is the use case made bottom up - does it have a\nstarting point property?\n3.     Is the use case correctly targetted on the real life situation or context. NB: It can be easy to mistake how data is presented on a website as opposed to how the thing being represented exists IRL, etc.\nReview outcomes:\n\nThe focus is the exhibiting of the paintings.\nStarting point is the painting.\nThe real life situation is the exhibition in buildings.\n\n\n\nSimple relationship model\nWrite out a hierarchy and ‘simple relationship model’ description in plain language. Make a description and indented list of properties. Mark the staring point property in the hierarchy.\nExample:\nA painting exhibition\n\nFederal state\n\nState\n\nPalace / Castle\n\nBuilding\n\nRoom\n\nPainting (starting point property)\n\nPainting image\nPainting text\n\nAuthor\nBibliography\n\nReferences\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReview questions:\n1.     Is the starting point identified\n2.     Does the hierarchy have enough properties to support the use case\n3.     Does the hierarchy have to many properties\n4.     In the parent / child indenting correct\nReview outcomes:\n\nPainting (starting point property)\nHas enough properties\nNot too many properties\nIndenting represents the relationships\n\n\n\nProperties table\nList the properties in a table. For the table add: Property; Possible Value(s) - Links to example source if available with description, if no link available add a description of the property; a Wikibase data types, and; comments. Add a table description and version number (see: semantic version numbering). The purpose of the Properties Table is as a starting place to create the data model as data, for team review, and to develop into a final data model.\nAdd what you can to the table. The process is exploratory, updates and corrections can be made in the review process.\nUsing a spreadsheet can be the simplest way to maintain the properties table, but any other table tool will do.\n\nNote: Wikibase data types: https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Help:Data_type\n\nExPropertyample:\n\n\n\nProperty\nPossible Value(s)\nData Type\nComments\n\n\n\n\npart of:\nDie Embleme (ist Teil von: Die Embleme [Bildzyklus] → picture cycle) https://www.deckenmalerei.eu/b5b59eba-aca7-4000-a67c-01440cb068c0\nstring\nThis property adds a relationship\n\n\nRaum\nRaum (ist Teil von: Raum [Raum] → room) https://www.deckenmalerei.eu/6653845a-e6a4-42a4-8647-147b56890a7c\nstring\n\n\n\ncommissioner:\nSchröder, Christian Albrecht (hat Auftraggeber: Schröder, Christian Albrecht [Person]) https://www.deckenmalerei.eu/6653845a-e6a4-42a4-8647-147b56890a7c\nstring\n\n\n\nVorlagengeber:\nBouhours, Dominique (hat Vorlagengeber: Bouhours, Dominique [Person]) https://www.deckenmalerei.eu/b5b59eba-aca7-4000-a67c-01440cb068c0\nstring\n\n\n\npainter:\nGünther, Matthäus (hat Maler: Günther, Matthäus [Person]) https://www.deckenmalerei.eu/f65cad80-c7f3-11e9-99f3-c9e55f39fadd\nstring\n\n\n\n\nTable: Properties table: Version 1.0, for a minimal data structure for Baroque paintings exhibited in buildings in the Federal State of Germany. Paintings are the focus object for the data model.\nLink to table as spreadsheet: link - to be confirmed\nReview questions:\n\nIs there a table description and version number\nHave all properties been added\nPossible Value(s): Are links or/and descriptions included\nHave Wikibase data types been added\n\nCollect data - round #1: The objectives here is test assumptions in the simple hierarchy and properties, and to see what other relationships need adding. Working with real data give the first opportunity to see if the properties can stay as ‘simple properties’ or if they need to become objects with their own properties.\nNote: Keep in mind the KISS Principles. The data model should be as lean as possible.\nRun software and/or prepare data to create a list of properties, e.g., In a Wikibase instance or as CSV file. This will show up some limits or parameters such as: Platform requirements, the use case, and KISS Principles, etc.\nA Wikibase Cloud version can be used for free to make an example of a data model. https://www.wikibase.cloud/\n\n\n\nExample Data models made in bottom up way\n\nImage upload to Wikibase via Wikicommons.\nInstructions: Wikimedia Commons and Wikibase.\n\nFilepath - which where image data is stored\nSource\nCopyright\nCreator\nDate\nDescription\nWikitext\nLocation",
