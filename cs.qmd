# Citizen Science {.unnumbered}

The project is to create a system where museum visitors create their own publication guides to museums using linked open data. The project is intended as a citizen science project and for this reason aspects of participation by the public and engagement with scholarship and learning are a priority.

  - The public can learn about chosen topics using museums.
  - The public can learn data science skills.
  - Museums can attract more visitors.
  - Museums can support deep learning in their respective knowledge domains.
  - A permanent record of museums work will be created.
  - Contributed to linked open data commons for researchers and the public - via data deposits and commons contributions, e.g., on Wikimedia Commons.
