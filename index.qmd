# Welcome {.unnumbered}

The idea! Museum have a calendar of exhibitions and a catalogue of what is on display in any give show. But this is not publishing in data repositories.

Welcome to 'Open Museum'! If museums made deposits of open data of what's on show - then their visitors could make 'play lists' of their favourite works and share them online.

The 'Open Museum' pitch is that the public take part in this cataloguing and a Citizen Science Experience.

The prototype 'Open Museum Guidebooks' has outlined the idea and is sharing the 'how to' model using Wikibase as a foundation. We believe all the infrastructure is already out there and with luck museums back catalogues could be online in no time (famous last words).
